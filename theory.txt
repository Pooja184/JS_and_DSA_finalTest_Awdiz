Q1.Explain the difference between var, let, and const. Provide examples of scope differences.
ans.    var,let and const are js variables.
        1. var-> var has global scope meaning we can access variables declared with var keyword anywhere in code.
                we can redeclare,reassign using var.
                hoisting is possible when we use var.
        2.let-> "let" introduced in ES6. 
                let keyword has block scope meaning we cannot access varibles declared with let keyword outside that scope.
                we can reassign but cannot redeclare values using let.
                hoisting is not possible.
        3.const-> "const" is also introduced in ES6.
                    It is used for constant values to avoid errors.
                    const has block scope meaning we cannot access variables declared with const keyword outside that scope.
                    we cannot reassign and redeclare values using let.
                    hoisting is not possible.

Q2. Explain hoisting with an example for both functions and variables.
ans.     hoisting means moving variables and functions at top of their scope.
        ex. function

            greet();
            function greet(){
                return "hello word"
            }

        ex. variable

            console.log(a);
            let a=10;

Q3.What are closures? Write a simple function demonstrating closure.
ans. closure happens when inner function remember the values from its outer scope.(lexical scope);
    ex. 
        function closureExample(){
            let a=4;
            function inner(num){
                 for(let i=0;i<=num;i++){
                console.log(a);
            }
            }
            inner(5)
           
        }
        closureExample();

Q4.What is event delegation in JavaScript? Why is it useful?
ans. Event delegation is a technique in JavaScript where a single event listener is attached to a parent element to handle events for its child elements.

    why it is useful:
    Reduces the number of event listeners, making the code more efficient.
    Easier to manage and maintain event handling logic.

Q5. How does the this keyword work in different contexts (global, object, class, arrow function)?
ans.Global Context:
        In the global scope, this refers to the global object (usually window in browsers).
    Object Context:
        When used within an object method, this refers to the object itself.
    Class Context:
        In a class, this refers to the instance of the class.
    Arrow Function Context:
        Arrow functions inherit this from their surrounding scope, rather than binding it to their own context.

Q6.What is the difference between == and === in JavaScript? Why is one preferred over the other?
ans. In JS == and === are used to compare values.
    == campares only values.
    === is introduced in ES6 which compares not only value but data type also.
    It hepls to prevent errors.
    always preferred === because it check both value and datatype. If we intentionally want to check only values at that time we can use ==. otherwise === is useful for safety purpose.

Q7. Explain the call(), apply(), and bind() methods with examples.
ans. The call(), apply(), and bind() methods in JavaScript are used to manipulate the this context and function arguments.

    call() Method:
    The call() method calls a function with a given this context and individual arguments.
    ex.
        function greet(age, city) {
        console.log(`Hello, my name is ${this.name} and I am ${age} years old from ${city}.`);
        }
        const person = { name: 'awdiz' };
        greet.call(person, 30, 'vashi');
    
    apply() Method:
    The apply() method calls a function with a given this context and an array of arguments.

        function greet(age, city) {
        console.log(`Hello, my name is ${this.name} and I am ${age} years old from ${city}.`);
        }
        const person = { name: 'awdiz' };
        const args = [30, 'vashi'];
        greet.apply(person, args);

    bind() Method:
    The bind() method creates a new function with a given this context and returns it.

        function greet(age, city) {
        console.log(`Hello, my name is ${this.name} and I am ${age} years old from ${city}.`);
        }
        const person = { name: 'awdiz' };
        const boundGreet = greet.bind(person, 30);
        boundGreet('vashi');

Q8. What are Promises and async/await? Show how to handle errors properly in both.
ans. Promises and async/await are used to handle asynchronous code.
    const promise = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
   
        if ( success ) {
            resolve(value);
        } else {
            reject(error);
        }
    });
    Handling Promises:
    promise
        .then((value) => {
            // handle success
        })
        .catch((error) => {
            // handle error
    });

    async/await:
    async function asyncFunction() {
    try {
        const value = await (asynchronous call);
        // handle success
    } catch (error) {
        // handle error
    }
    }

Q9.What is event loop in JavaScript? Explain the difference between microtasks and macrotasks with an example.
ans. The event loop is a single-threaded mechanism that processes tasks (or events) in a queue. It continuously checks the queue for new tasks and executes them one by one
